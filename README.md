# OpenCV Advanced FaceTracker

This program serves as an analyzer that applies some HAAR Cascades classifiers, already gathered in the "haarcascades" folder and described in the XML file "data.xml". In this file you can modify the description and the name/caption that is desplayed when detected. Also you can use only the classifiers that you are interested in.

The most interesting feature in this little project is that you can specify a ROI (region of interest) delimited by 2 horizontal and 2 vertical lines, the goal is the reduction of the computing time. It's very useful especially when processing a video.

The next step is to use pyQT since it helps to design more efficient and cool interfaces.

Your contribution is welcome :D.
